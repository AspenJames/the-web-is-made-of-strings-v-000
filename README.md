# Text to the infinity and beyond

The web is made up of computers exchanging strings of text. **The web is changing the world every day, and at its core, it's simply a way to transfer text**. The ex



text represents words and those words express information, ideas, and feelings.

We should not be surprised by the profound impact of this technology. The printed book is also a way to transfer text from one person to another and the ideas transferred through books also changed the world. The web is simply an absurdly faster way of exchanging information with no central authority. **Everyone is an author**.

Respect to the book, the web has the additional superpower of immediately relating information. Not only can we  exchange information with one another, but the information itself can reference other pieces of information. How does this happen? We will get to that soon! **As with everything on the web the answer is just one click or tap away**.

**The text sent back and forth on the web are formatted as HTML** and decorated via CSS. A byproduct of the web being built as a collection of HTML text (strings) is that we can right-click anywhere on a webpage, select "View Page Source" and you'll see the HTML that makes up that website. That is true for any website; there are no exceptions.

Let's peek behind the scenes of two of our favorites websites to see how they are built. Wikipedia and Google.

**Wikipedia's homepage:**

Much of that will look like gobbledygook, and that's fine for now. The goal of this section is not to become an HTML guru but to understand how HTML is an integral part of the web and know enough HTML to build something functional.

Now peak behind your two favorite websites. Visit them and view their page source. You will see that **behind that product you love are a collection of HTML strings**.

After completing this section, you should have:

- An understanding of the web in a nutshell and its value proposition
- Understand the relationship between the web and HTML
- Know how to construct a properly formatted HTML document
- An understanding of the semantic meaning and use of the key HTML elements
- An understanding of how to decorate elements using CSS
- Given a website image mockup have a sense of how the HTML should be structured
