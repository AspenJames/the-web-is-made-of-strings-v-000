# The Web Is Made of HTML

The web is made up of machines sending strings of text back and forth. **The web is changing the world every day, and at its core, it's simply a way to transfer text**. That text is used to express information, ideas, and feelings.

We should not be surprised by the profound impact of this technology. The printed book is also a way to transfer text from one person to another and the ideas transferred through books also changed the world. The web is simply a faster way of exchanging information with no central authority. **Everyone is an author**. Respect to the book the web has the additional superpower of relating information to one another. Not only we can exchange information with one another, but the information itself can reference other pieces of information. We will get to that soon!

**The strings sent back and forth on the web are formatted as  HTML** and decorated via CSS. A byproduct of the web being build as a collection of HTML strings is that we can right click anywhere on a webpage, select "View Page Source" and you'll see the HTML that makes up that website. That is true for any website; there are no exceptions.

Let's peek behind the scenes of two of our favorites websites to see how they are built. Wikipedia and Google.

Much of that will look like gobbledygook and that's fine for now. The goal of this section is not to become an HTML guru but to understand how HTML is an integral part of the web and know enough HTML to build something functional.

Now take a peak behind your two favorite websites. Visit them and view their page source. You will see that **behind that product you love are a collection of HTML strings**.

After completing this section you should have:
- An understanding of the web in a nutshell and it's value proposition

- Know how to construct a properly formatted HTML document
- Understanding the semantic meaning and use of the key HTML elements
