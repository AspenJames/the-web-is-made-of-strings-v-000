# The Web Is Made of HTML

**Everything you've ever seen on the web is expressed through HTML** and decorated via CSS. The web is made up of machines sending strings of text back and forth.

A byproduct of the web being build as a collection of strings is that we can right click anywhere on a webpage, select "View Page Source" and you'll see the HTML that makes up that website. That is true for any website; there are no exceptions.

Let's peek behind the scenes of two of our favorites websites to see how they are built. Wikipedia and Google.

Much of that will look like gobbledygook and that's fine for now. The goal of this section is not to become an HTML guru but to understand how HTML is an integral part of the web and know enough HTML to build something functional

After completing this section you should have:
- An understanding of the web in a nutshell
- Understand the relationship between the web and HTML
- Know how to construct a properly formatted HTML document
- Understanding the semantic meaning and use of the key HTML elements
- Given a website image mockup have a sense of how the HTML should be structured
