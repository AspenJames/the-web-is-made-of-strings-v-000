# The Web Is Made of HTML

**HTML is the basic language that websites are built in**. Everything you've ever seen on the web is expressed through HTML and is decorated via CSS. You can see HTML all around you in fact.

For example, if you just right click on this browser window, and then select "View Page Source" you'll be whisked away to the magical land of HTML.

Much of that will look like gobbledy-gook right now and that's fine right now. The goal of this section is not to become an HTML guru. We will teach you enough HTML to build something functional. 

After completing this section you should have:
- An understanding of the web in a nutshell
- Understand the relationship between the web and HTML
- Know how to construct a properly formatted HTML document
- Understanding the semantic meaning and use of the key HTML elements
- Given a website image mockup have a sense of how the HTML should be structured
